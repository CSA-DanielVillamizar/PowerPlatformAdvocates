# Lab 03 - Work with solutions with a team

In Lab 02 you learned how to work with solutions. Now we are going to focus on building solutions when you're in a team.

* What do you need to do when you were working on another project in the mean time and your team member has improved the solution in the dev environment? 
(pac solution clone / pac solution sync)
* What do you need to do when a team member updated the solution in source control and you want to get the latest version from that? (pac solution pack + pac solution import)
* We are all team players, so we all want to make sure our solution works. Lets run a check for errors before we deploy the solution to production (pac solution check)
