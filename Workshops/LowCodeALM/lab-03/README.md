# Lab 03 - Work with solutions with a team

In Lab 02 you learned how to work with solutions. Now we are going to focus on building solutions when you're in a team. 

In this lab, you will have to imagine you're someone else. You will pretend you are your colleague in the following tasks:

* Add a screen to the MR app
* Create a new branch
* Sync the updated solution to the new branch
* Run the solution checker
* Commit the changes to the new branch
* Create a pull request (PR)

## Task 01: Add a screen to the MR app

In this task, you will act like you're a colleague who wants to change the Mixed Reality solution you imported in lab 02.
