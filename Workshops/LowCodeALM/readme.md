# Low Code Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to apply Application Lifecycle Management in a low code world. You will learn multiple best practices during this workshop. This workshop consists of multiple labs:

## Lab 01 - Tenant setup

In this lab, you will login to the account you are going to use during the workshop and you will create developer environments.

[Lab 01 - Tenant Setup](./lab-01/readme.md)

## Lab 02 - Work with solutions

In lab 02, you will learn about how to work with solutions. You will learn how to package a solution that's already unpacked locally. Next you will learn how to import the packed solution, you will learn how to clone it. And last but not least, you will inspect the solution to see what the structure of the solution is.

## Lab 03 - Work with solutions with a team

Now that you experienced how to work with solutions by yourself, let's also look at how to work together on solutions. How do you co-author a solution together with other developers? How does this work with developer environments?

## Lab 04 - Deploy the solution to test and production

You will learn how to deploy the solution that we created to a different environment using pipelines for Power Platform in lab 04. This will include the setup of pipelines for Power Platform, how to create a pipeline & how to deploy a pipeline using it.

[Lab 04 - Deploy the solution to test and production](./lab-04/readme.md)

## Lab 05 - Update the solution with a new version

After the deployment to the test and production environments we're done! No - of course not! A solution is never finished, so in this lab, we will update the solution to a new version check if the solution has any errors, and deploy the new solution version to the test and the production environments.
