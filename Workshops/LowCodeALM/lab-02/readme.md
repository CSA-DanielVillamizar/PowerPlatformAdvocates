# Lab 02 - Work with solutions

In this lab you will learn the following:

* Import a solution zip file
* Export a solution from an environment
* Unpack a solution
* Inspect the solution folders
* Clone a solution


## Task 1: Import a solution zip file

In this task you will import a solution zip file into your Developer Environment. The solution that you will be working with throughout this workshop is from our [Mixed Reality Workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatformAdvocates/blob/main/Workshops/MR/README.md). 

But first - you need to upload a couple of assets to your OneDrive. (Do I need to explain what we're adding?)

1. In the browser, navigate to [OneDrive](https://portal.office.com/onedrive) and sign in with your credentials for this workshop

Since this is most probably your first time signing into OneDrive with these credentials, you will see a welcome screen.

2. Click **Your OneDrive is ready**

3. Once inside OneDrive, select **My files** on the left navigation bar.

Now you will be downloading the assets needed to upload to your OneDrive.

4. In a new browser tab, navigate to the [Coral Collection.zip](../assets/OneDrive%20folder/Coral%20Collection.zip) folder in this repository

5. Download the zip file to your computer
