## Create developer environments

Developer environments are very helpful when you want to try out features, they are meant to be short living environments.

For this workshop, we are going to create three different developer environments:

* Dev | The environment where we are going to import our solution later on.
* Test | The environment where we are going to deploy our solution to in lab four.
* Prod | The environment where we are going to deploy our solution to in lab four.

To create developer environments, you can create them in two ways:

1. Via the Power Platform Admin Center
1. Via the Power Platform CLI

In this workshop, we will create the environments through the Power Platform Admin Center.

## Create a GitHub account
