# Podcast Copilot with Azure OpenAI Service, .NET, and Power Platform

This series explores the integration of the Power Platform with advanced AI models to create a dynamic application inspired by Kevin Scottâ€™s Microsoft Build 2023 demo (https://github.com/microsoft/podcastcopilot). Make it easy to generate a social media post promoting a new episode of your podcast. Starting from a podcast URL, we journey through speech-to-text transcription to generate a transcript of the podcast, given that transcript, we perform guest identification and guest bio retrieval, followed by social media post generation with image creation, and finally, posting to LinkedIn from Power Apps or Power Virtual Agents. All powered by Azure OpenAI Service and the Power Platform!
