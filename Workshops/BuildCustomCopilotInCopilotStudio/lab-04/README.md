# Lab 04 - Create a custom topic with a plugin action for Generative Actions

A prompt plugin can also be executed inside of a Topic to create a controlled user experience and add further logic and/or processing of the copilot.  The prompt plugin can be added as a plugin action inside the authoring canvas.
